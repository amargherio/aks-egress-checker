# Contributing
There's not a lot of rules and requirements for contributing to this project.

## Prerequisites
This project is built using Rust and has dependencies for container builds,
so the prerequisites are pretty short:

* Rust (latest version is what I use, but I aim to support the last two stable versions as well)
* Docker or Podman for container builds

## Contributing code fixes
If you're interested in contributing code fixes or new features/functionality into this application
I recommend forking this repository and following a standard GitHub PR process. It's strongly encouraged
to open an issue prior to submitting a PR (although I can work around that if it's missed).

At this time, pull requests can be submitted for merge into main.

Some thoughts/suggestions for code contributions:
* If possble, try to ensure test coverage accounts for changes in functionality.
* I'm not so concerned about PR size as long as everything is well-reasoned and commented/documented.
